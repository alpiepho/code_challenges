### (Personal) binary_counter.c

Given a number N, list all the possible binary strings.  N is the number of bits.  For example:
```
Size: 3
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111
```

### (LeetCode, Easy) Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specfic target.  Assume exactly one solution.

Given nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
Return [0, 1]

### (Personal) Any Sum
:warning: NOTE: this was not finished

Expand 'Two Sum' to look for any number values from nums that sum to the value 'target'.  Each num is used once.  Size of solution array can be 1 to n.

Given nums = [2,4,6,1], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 2 + 6 + 1 = 9
Return [0, 2, 3]
